 Heart Disease Prediction Web Application
 
üìÑ Project Description
This project is a user-friendly web application that predicts an individual‚Äôs risk of heart disease based on their health details. The application uses a Logistic Regression machine learning model, trained on a heart disease dataset (heart.csv).

Users can input their health parameters, and the system predicts the risk percentage, categorizes the risk level (low, moderate, or high), provides health suggestions, shows a feature importance chart, and allows downloading a personalized PDF report.

üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Machine learning prediction using Logistic Regression.

‚úÖ Interactive input form for user details.

‚úÖ Risk percentage and level display (low, moderate, high).

‚úÖ Personalized health suggestions.

‚úÖ Feature importance visualization (bar chart).

‚úÖ PDF report download option.

‚úÖ Attractive UI with animations and gradients.

üíª How to Run This Project on Another 

Step 1: Copy the Project Files
Copy the entire project folder to the new system.

Ensure it contains:

sml.py (Flask main app)

templates/ folder with HTML files (predict.html, result.html, pdf_template.html)

static/ folder with style.css and feature_importance.png

heart.csv dataset.

Step 2: Install Python
Install Python (recommended version: 3.9 or above).

Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Step 3: Install Required Python Packages
Open terminal (or command prompt) inside the project folder.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit

pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib weasyprint
Note: On Windows, WeasyPrint might require extra libraries. Check WeasyPrint installation guide if needed.

Step 4: Check Dataset
Ensure heart.csv is present in the project folder.

If missing, download it from Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset.

Step 5: Run the Flask Application
In terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sml.py
You will see:

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ User enters health details (e.g., age, cholesterol, BP, heart rate).

2Ô∏è‚É£ The model predicts the risk percentage of heart disease.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Displays risk level:

Low

Moderate

High

4Ô∏è‚É£ Provides personalized health suggestions.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Shows a feature importance chart to help understand key risk factors.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Option to download PDF report with prediction and suggestions.

‚≠ê Advantages

Raises awareness of heart health.

Easy and interactive for non-technical users.

Useful for initial health screening before consulting a doctor.

Fully offline, runs locally on your machine.

‚úÖ Summary
This project integrates data science and healthcare in a simple web app that helps users understand their heart disease risk. It combines predictive analytics, visual insights, and health advice in a single, accessible platform.
